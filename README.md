# The Keep Calm and Carry on Coding Website

Keep Calm and Carry on Coding is a fortnightly meetup for women at the beginning of their coding journey. 

This repo is for the group's website https://keepcalmandcarryoncoding.herokuapp.com/

# Goals

The website is meant to:
  * Explain what the group is about
  * Inform about its latest events
  * Make it easier for women who are just getting started in their coding journey to connect to women-friendly coding communities around them
  
# Description

The site is built on Flask and Python with a little bit of JavaScript. The routes.py file describes the routes. The templates files have the HTML templates.

# Find your Crowd

The Find your Crowd page is built to map upcoming coding events for women and bring in the information on their date, topic and location.

# How it looks
